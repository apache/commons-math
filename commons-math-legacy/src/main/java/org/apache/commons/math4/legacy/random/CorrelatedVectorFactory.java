/**
 * Generates vectors with with correlated components.
 *
 * <p>Random vectors with correlated components are built by combining
 * the uncorrelated components of another random vector in such a way
 * that the resulting correlations are the ones specified by a positive
 * definite covariance matrix.</p>
 *
 * <p>The main use of correlated random vector generation is for Monte-Carlo
 * simulation of physical problems with several variables (for example to
 * generate error vectors to be added to a nominal vector). A particularly
 * common case is when the generated vector should be drawn from a
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution">
 * Multivariate Normal Distribution</a>, usually using Cholesky decomposition.
 * Other distributions are possible as long as the underlying sampler provides
 * normalized values (unit standard deviation).</p>
 *
 * <p>Sometimes, the covariance matrix for a given simulation is not
 * strictly positive definite. This means that the correlations are
 * not all independent from each other. In this case, however, the non
 * strictly positive elements found during the Cholesky decomposition
 * of the covariance matrix should not be negative either, they
 * should be null. Another non-conventional extension handling this case
 * is used here. Rather than computing <code>C = U<sup>T</sup> U</code>
 * where <code>C</code> is the covariance matrix and <code>U</code>
 * is an upper-triangular matrix, we compute <code>C = B B<sup>T</sup></code>
 * where <code>B</code> is a rectangular matrix having more rows than
 * columns. The number of columns of <code>B</code> is the rank of the
 * covariance matrix, and it is the dimension of the uncorrelated
 * random vector that is needed to compute the component of the
 * correlated vector. This class handles this situation automatically.</p>
