    <release version="2.0" date="TBD" description="TBD">
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="MATH-238" due-to="Chritian Semrau">
        Fixed an error in gcd computation for large values.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Added method to walk matrix entries with or without changing them in the
        visitor design pattern sense. Three different orders can be used, row by row,
        column by column or optimized order according to internal storage. Optimized
        order should be preferred when no specific order is needed, because it will be
        more cache efficient.

        it is feasible.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="MATH-221" due-to="Dieter Roth">
        Changed the Complex.equals() method so that it considers +0 and -0 are equal,
        as required by IEEE-754 standard.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" issue="MATH-220">
        Added JAMA-like interfaces for eigen/singular problems. The implementation
        are based on the very quick dqd/dqds algorithms and some parts of the MRRR
        algorithm. This leads to very fast and accurate solutions.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" issue="MATH-220" >
        Added JAMA-like interfaces for decomposition algorithms. These interfaces
        decompose a matrix as a product of several other matrices with predefined
        properties and shapes depending on the algorithm. These algorithms allow to
        solve the equation A * X = B, either for an exact linear solution
        (LU-decomposition) or an exact or least-squares solution (QR-decomposition).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" issue="MATH-219" due-to="Andrew Berry">
        Added removeData methods for the SimpleRegression class. This allows
        to support regression calculations across a sliding window of (time-based)
        observations without having to recalculate for the entire window every time.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" due-to="Andreas Rieger">
        Support for one dimensional vectors has been added to the linear algebra
        package with a RealVector interface, a RealVectorImpl default implementation
        using a single double array to store elements and a RealVectorFormat for
        input/output.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="update" issue="MATH-217">
        Changed OLS regression implementation added in MATH-203 to use
        QR decomposition to solve the normal equations.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        New ODE integrators have been added: the explicit Adams-Bashforth and implicit
        Adams-Moulton multistep methods. These methods support customizable starter
        integrators and support discrete events even during the start phase.
        All these methods provide the same rich features has the existing ones:
        continuous output, step handlers, discrete events, G-stop ...
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="MATH-214" >
        Replaced size adjustment of all steps of fixed steps Runge-Kutta integrators by
        a truncation of the last step only.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The ODE integrators now support several step handlers at once, instead of just one.
        This is more consistent with event handlers management.
        The setStepHandler method has therefore been replaced by addStephandler, the
        getStepHandler method has been replaced by getStepHandlers which returns a Collection
        and a clearStepHandlers method has been added.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        All step interpolators for ODE integrators now provide interpolation for
        both the state and its time derivatives. The interpolated derivatives are
        the exact derivatives of the interpolated state, thus preserving consistency.
        The general step handlers hence do not need to call the derivation function
        anymore. The fixed step handlers also get the time derivative of the state
        as an additional argument along with the state when they are called.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="MATH-213" >
        Changed return type for FirstOrderIntegrator.integrate() to double
        in order to retrieve exact stop time. This allows to handle properly
        integration interruption due to an EventHandler instance asking to
        stop the integration when its associated event is triggered. The state
        was already set to the current state at interruption time, but it was
        difficult to get the corresponding time (it involved setting a step
        handler monitoring the last step specially).
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Clarified the ODE package by breaking in into several sub-packages and renaming
        classes (SwitchingFunctions/EventHandler, SwitchingFunctionsHandler/CombinedEventsManager)
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="MATH-210" >
        Changed return type for FirstOrderIntegrator.getSwitchingFunctions()
        to a collection of SwitchingFunction instances. This better suits the
        intended use of the method and fixes a visibility error since the
        previous return type referenced the package private SwitchState class.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="MATH-209" due-to="Thomas Chust">
        Fixed dimension error on output vector for the operate method
        in RealMatrixImpl and BigMatrixImpl classes.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The FirstOrderDifferentialEquations, FirstOrderIntegrator and FixedStepHandler
        interfaces now extends Serializable, allowing integrators, problems and
        handlers to be embedded into users Serializable classes.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added several convenience methods and constants for Vector3D and Rotation.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Replaced public no argument constructors with IDENTITY or ZERO
        static instances for immutable classes Vector3D and Rotation.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix">
        Fixed inconsistencies in the naming scheme for static fields in
        Vector3D and Rotation with respect to the overall library.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        Greatly improved RealMatrixImpl and BigMatrixImpl performances,
        both in terms of speed and in terms of temporary memory footprint.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" issue="MATH-203" due-to="Mauro Talevi">
        Added Mauro's patch to support multiple regression.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        Starting with version 2.0 of the library, the minimal version of the Java
        platform required to compile and use commons-math is Java 5. This version
        is widely deployed now on many systems. It brings new important features
        for specific mathematical developments, for example new functions (log10,
        cbrt, ulp, signum, cosh, sinh, tanh, hypot, expm1, log1p), autoboxing,
        MathContext or RoundingMode. It also brings important features for general
        development, for example enums, generics or annotations.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" >
        Switching functions can now throw dedicated SwitchException from all their
        method. At upper call level, the various ODE integrators handle these new
        exceptions and wrap them into IntegratorException instances, hence the
        integrators methods signature did not change.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" issue="MATH-202">
        Added the getSwitchingFunctions and clearSwitchingFunctions to the
        FirstOrderIntegrator interface and all its implementations
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update" >
        Removed deprecated features. This includes the following changes. Factory-based
        instantiation replaced by setter injection in 1.2 in several classes have been
        removed. Protected fields in matrices implementations have been declared final
        and private. Identity factory methods moved to MatrixUtils class have been
        removed. Complex utilities methods that have been superseded by Complex instance
        methods have been removed.
      </action>

        Fixed several crashes in getCovariances() and guessParametersErrors() in
        AbstractEstimator when some parameters are bound. The methods now explicitly
        give result only about unbound parameters.
      </action>
      <action dev="brentworden" type="fix" issue="MATH-201" due-to="Peter Wyngaard">
