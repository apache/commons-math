This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the 
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a bugzilla search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
CVS commits.  Set the project.properties' maven.changelog.range 
property to the number of days since the last release.

    <release version="2.0" date="2009-08-03" description="
This is a major release. It combines bug fixes, new features and
changes to existing features. Most notable among the new features are:
decomposition algorithms in the linear algebra package (LU, QR, Cholesky,
SVD, eigen decomposition) which are based on the popular JAMA API (but
much faster); support for sparse matrices and vectors;
support for any field-based matrix (Complex, Fraction ...);
support for genetic algorithms;
several new optimization algorithms (Dantzig's simplex for linear
constrained problems, conjugate gradient, Brent);
support for curve fitting with special cases for harmonic and polynomial
functions;
support for state derivative in ODE step handlers;
new multistep integrators (Adams-Bashforth and Adams-Moulton) with
variable stepsize;
regression algorithms;
rank transformations;
Mersenne twister pseudo random number generator.
This release is NOT source and binary compatible with earlier versions
of Commons Math. Starting with version 2.0 of the library, the minimal
version of the Java platform required to compile and use commons-math
is Java 5.  Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version, as in addition
to new features, this release includes numerous bug fixes.  Users of 
Commons Math 1.0-1.2 should recompile their code against the 2.0 jar. 
Most of the compilation errors users will encounter after the switch
will be due to classes moved due to package reorganization.  These errors
are simply solved by adjusting the import statements in users code.">

      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        New ODE integrators have been added: the explicit Adams-Bashforth and implicit
        Adams-Moulton multistep methods. As the implementations of these methods are based
        on Nordsieck vector rather than a traditional array of previous steps, they both
        have been improved to handle adaptive stepsize. These methods provide the same rich
        features has the existing ones: continuous output, step handlers, discrete events,
        G-stop ...

        Replaced size adjustment of all steps of fixed steps Runge-Kutta integrators by
        a truncation of the last step only.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The ODE integrators now support several step handlers at once, instead of just one.
        This is more consistent with event handlers management.
        The setStepHandler method has therefore been replaced by addStephandler, the
        getStepHandler method has been replaced by getStepHandlers which returns a Collection
        and a clearStepHandlers method has been added.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        All ODE integrators now support setting a maximal number of evaluations of differential
        equations function. If this number is exceeded, an exception will be thrown during
        integration. This can be used to prevent infinite loops if for example error control or
        discrete events create a really large number of extremely small steps.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        All step interpolators for ODE integrators now provide interpolation for
        both the state and its time derivatives. The interpolated derivatives are
        the exact derivatives of the interpolated state, thus preserving consistency.
        The general step handlers hence do not need to call the derivation function
        anymore. The fixed step handlers also get the time derivative of the state
        as an additional argument along with the state when they are called.

        Changed return type for FirstOrderIntegrator.integrate() to double
        in order to retrieve exact stop time. This allows to handle properly
        integration interruption due to an EventHandler instance asking to
        stop the integration when its associated event is triggered. The state
        was already set to the current state at interruption time, but it was
        difficult to get the corresponding time (it involved setting a step
        handler monitoring the last step specially).

        Starting with version 2.0 of the library, the minimal version of the Java

        for specific mathematical developments, for example new functions (log10,
        cbrt, ulp, signum, cosh, sinh, tanh, hypot, expm1, log1p), autoboxing,
