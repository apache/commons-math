      <p>This page aims to be a handy reference of work pending for the next
      planned release.  Users who want new features should submit patches to this
      page in the unclassified section.  Developers who want to lend a hand can
      grab tasks from this page. Everyone can see the progress which is being
      made.</p>

      <p>The following is a list of items still <code>TODO</code> for Math.  
      Contributions are welcome!</p>
      <subsection name="Documentation and Code Conformance Tasks">
        <p>Many of these will always be a required. Please focus on applying
        format standards and provide as many test cases as possible for your
        code.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Performance and accuracy testing.</dt>
          <dd>If anyone is interested in helping out here, we could really use
           a wider selection of test cases for the core numerical functions and
           validation against either other packages (e.g. R for the statistical
           stuff), verified datasets, or experiments comparing implementions
           using floats to doubles.</dd>
          <dt>Test Coverage.</dt>
          <dd>Clover tests show some remaining gaps in test path coverage. Goal
           is to get all tests to 100% coverage.  Also improve test data and
           boundary conditions coverage.</dd>
          <dt>Code review.</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Code review is a continuous process that all Contributors and
             Developers should practice while working on the code base.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Verify that the code matches the documentation and identify
               inefficiencies or numerical problems.  All feedback/suggestions
               for improvement/patches are welcome.</li>
