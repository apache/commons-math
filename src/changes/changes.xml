    <release version="3.6" date="2016-01-05" description="
This is a minor release: It combines bug fixes and new features.
 Changes to existing features were made in a backwards-compatible
 way such as to allow drop-in replacement of the v3.x JAR file.

Most notable among the new features are:
 field-based version of Ordinary Differential Equations framework,
 numerous improvements in distributions, statistics and neuralnet packages,
 refactored implementation of microsphere interpolation algorithm,
 explicit specification of rotation convention to use (both vector
 operator and frame transform conventions are now available).

The minimum version of the Java platform required to compile and use
 Commons Math is Java 5.

Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as this release not
 only includes bug fixes but also deprecates numerous classes and
 methods that will be deleted from the next major release (4.0).

  Caveat:
  1. The implementation of the BOBYQA optimization algorithm is in alpha
  state (cf. MATH-621): Many code paths are untested, and we are looking
  for volunteers to improve the code readability, robustness and performance
  and to extend the unit tests suite.
  2. A few methods in the FastMath class are in fact slower that their
  counterpart in either Math or StrictMath (cf. MATH-740 and MATH-901).
">
      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix" issue="MATH-1310">
        Improved performance and accuracy of 2-sample KolmogorovSmirnov tests.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="MATH-1297">
        Detect start failures with multi-step ODE integrators.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" issue="MATH-1302,MATH-1303">
        Added a RotationConvention enumerate to allow specifying the semantics
        or axis/angle for rotations. This enumerate has two values:
        VECTOR_OPERATOR and FRAME_TRANSFORM.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" due-to="Julien Queyrel">
        Fixed stability issues with Adams-Bashforth and Adams-Moulton ODE integrators.
        The integrators did not estimate the local error properly and were sometimes
        stuck attempting to reduce indefinitely the step size as they thought the
        error was too high.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" issue="MATH-1288">
        Added a field-based version of Ordinary Differential Equations framework.
        This allows integrating ode that refer to RealField elements instead of
        primitive double, hence opening the way to use DerivativeStructure to
        compute partial differential without using variational equations, or to solve
        ode with extended precision using Dfp.

This is a minor release: It combines bug fixes and new features.
 Changes to existing features were made in a backwards-compatible
 way such as to allow drop-in replacement of the v3.4.1 JAR file.
  
Most notable among the new features are:
 getQuadraticMean method added to DescriptiveStatistics SummaryStatistics

  1. The implementation of the BOBYQA optimization algorithm is in alpha

This is a minor release: It combines bug fixes and new features.
 Changes to existing features were made in a backwards-compatible
 way such as to allow drop-in replacement of the v3.3 JAR file.
  
Most notable among the new features are:
 new distributions (Gumbel, Laplace, Logistic, Nakagami), and
 improvements on percentiles algorithms (better handling for NaNs
 in the regular algorithm, plus a new storeless implementation).
 Bicubic and tricubic interpolators have been fixed and new
 implementations added. There have been numerous bug fixes and
 several improvements on performances or robustness. See below

    <release version="3.2" date="2013-04-06" description="
This is a minor release: It combines bug fixes and new features.
 Changes to existing features were made in a backwards-compatible
 way such as to allow drop-in replacement of the v3.1[.1] JAR file.
  
Most notable among the new features are: Framework for automatic
 differentiation, Lévy distribution, prime numbers, enumerated
 distributions, real field allowing to use several algorithms
 (solvers, linear algebra, 3D geometry) with different real-like
 classes (high accuracy or automatic differentiation), spherical
 coordinates with gradients and Hessians, reorganized clustering
 package with different distance implementations.
  
The minimum version of the Java platform required to compile and use
 Commons Math is Java 5.
  
Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as this release not
 only includes bug fixes but also deprecates numerous classes and
 methods that will be deleted from the next major release (4.0).
  
  Caveat:
  1. The implementation of the BOBYQA optimization algorithm is in alpha
  state (cf. MATH-621): Many code paths are untested, and we are looking
  for volunteers to improve the code readability, robustness and performance
  and to extend the unit tests suite.
  2. A few methods in the FastMath class are in fact slower that their
  counterpart in either Math or StrictMath (cf. MATH-740 and MATH-901).

    </release>

    <release version="3.1" date="2012-12-23" description="
This is a minor release: It combines bug fixes and new features.
  Changes to existing features were made in a backwards-compatible
  way such as to allow drop-in replacement of the v3.0 JAR file.
  
  Most notable among the new features are: Framework for automatic
  differentiation, multivariate mixture model distribution, quaternions,
  Gauss integration framework, Hermite polynomial interpolation,
  eigenvalue decomposition of non-symmetric matrices, DBSCAN clustering.
  Most notable among the changes are: Greatly improved precision in
  the implementation of the Gamma and Beta special functions, optimizers
  API, deprecation of the sparse vector implementation.
  
  The minimal version of the Java platform required to compile and use
  Commons Math is Java 5.
  Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as this release not
  only includes bug fixes but also deprecates numerous classes and
  methods that will be deleted from the next major release (4.0).
  
  Caveat:
  1. The implementation of the BOBYQA optimization algorithm is in alpha
  state (cf. MATH-621): Many code paths are untested, and we are looking
  for volunteers to improve the code readability, robustness and performance
  and to extend the unit tests suite.
  2. A few methods in the FastMath class are in fact slower that their
  counterpart in either Math or StrictMath (cf. MATH-740 and MATH-901).

    <release version="3.0" date="2012-03-07" description="
This is a major release: It combines bug fixes, new features and
changes to existing features.

Most notable among the new features are: Iterative solvers, Kalman filter,
ISAAC RNG, Illinois and Pegasus root finders, enhanced ODE framework,
refactored geometry package, Binary Space Partition trees.

Most notable among the changes are: Exclusive use of unchecked exceptions,
removal of interfaces for which a single implementation is assumed to exist,
improved coding and API consistency across packages, performance (matrix
product, FFT) and robustness (SVD).

Because of the base package name change, this release can be used together
with earlier versions of Commons Math.
The minimal version of the Java platform required to compile and use
Commons Math is Java 5.
Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as, in addition to new
features, this release includes numerous bug fixes.
Users of Commons Math 2.0-2 should recompile their code against the 3.0 JAR
file and must adjust the import statements to use the appropriate
org.apache.commons.math3 base package.
Most of the compilation errors users will encounter after the switch will
be due to moved or deleted classes/interfaces resulting from package
reorganization.

1. The implementation of the BOBYQA optimization algorithm is in alpha state
(cf. MATH-621): Many code paths are untested, and we are looking
for volunteers to improve the code readability, robustness and performance
and to extend the unit tests suite.
2. A few methods in the FastMath class are in fact slower that their
counterpart in either Math or StrictMath (cf. MATH-740).

    <release version="2.2" date="2011-03-02" description="
This is primarily a maintenance release, but it also includes new features and enhancements.

  Users of version 2.1 are encouraged to upgrade to 2.2, as this release includes some important bug fixes.

  See the detailed list of changes below for full description of all bug fixes and enhancements.

  This release contains some minor compatibility breaks with version 2.1 in some internal classes but none
  of them are in APIs likely to be accessed by user code:
  the MessagesResources_fr class has been removed (replaced by a properties file);
  the arguments of the EventState.reinitializeBegin method have changed;
  some protected fields which already had public accessors in AbstractStepInterpolator have been replaced.

  There is a behavior change that users of the multiple regression classes should be aware of. In version
  2.1, there was no way to estimate models without intercept terms, and, while this was not clear from
  the documentation, design (X) matrices needed to include initial unitary columns.  In 2.2, initial
  unitary columns are not necessary and whether or not models include intercept terms is configurable.
  See the change log and javadoc for the classes in org.apache.commons.math3.stat.regression for details.

  The major new features are:
  a new FastMath class, both faster, more accurate and with a few additional functions than StrictMath and Math;
  a new package for floating point arbitrary precision computing, including high level functions like exponential, sine, square root ...;
  new linear and tricubic interpolators;
  a new Gaussian curve fitter;
  a new erfc function;
  characteristic support for distributions;
  a set of new Well Equidistributed Long-period Linear (WELL) random generators.">

  Users of version 2.0 are encouraged to upgrade to 2.1, as this release includes some important bug fixes.

  See the detailed list of changes below for full description of all bug fixes and enhancements.

  This release contains some minor API compatibility breaks with version 2.0:
  the return type of RealVector.copy() has been changed to AbstractRealVector;
  the no-argument constructor of MatrixUtils() has been made private;
  the mapXxxToSelf methods of OpenMapRealVector have been removed and some method return types have been changed in this class;
  new methods have been added to the RealVector interface;
  several fields in AdaptiveStepSizeIntegrator have been made final;
  DummyStepInterpolator requires an additional argument for one of its constructors;
  some protected fields have been removed from AbstractLeastSquaresOptimizer, AbstractScalarDifferentiableOptimizer and AbstractLinearOptimizer;
  and the isOptimal(SimplexTableau) method has been removed from SimplexSolver. ">

    <release version="2.0" date="2009-08-03" description="
This is a major release. It combines bug fixes, new features and
changes to existing features. Most notable among the new features are:
decomposition algorithms in the linear algebra package (LU, QR, Cholesky,
SVD, eigen decomposition) which are based on the popular JAMA API (but
much faster); support for sparse matrices and vectors;
support for any field-based matrix (Complex, Fraction ...);
support for genetic algorithms;
several new optimization algorithms (Dantzig's simplex for linear
constrained problems, conjugate gradient, Brent);
support for curve fitting with special cases for harmonic and polynomial
functions;
support for state derivative in ODE step handlers;
new multistep integrators (Adams-Bashforth and Adams-Moulton) with
variable stepsize;
regression algorithms;
rank transformations;
Mersenne twister pseudo random number generator.
This release is NOT source and binary compatible with earlier versions
of Commons Math. Starting with version 2.0 of the library, the minimal
version of the Java platform required to compile and use Commons Math
is Java 5.  Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version, as in addition
to new features, this release includes numerous bug fixes.  Users of
Commons Math 1.0-1.2 should recompile their code against the 2.0 jar.
Most of the compilation errors users will encounter after the switch
will be due to classes moved due to package reorganization.  These errors
are simply solved by adjusting the import statements in users code.">

      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" issue="MATH-220">
        Added JAMA-like interfaces for eigen/singular problems. The implementation

      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add" issue="MATH-220" >
        Added JAMA-like interfaces for decomposition algorithms. These interfaces
        decompose a matrix as a product of several other matrices with predefined
        properties and shapes depending on the algorithm. These algorithms allow to
        solve the equation A * X = B, either for an exact linear solution
        (LU-decomposition, Cholesky decomposition) or an exact or least-squares
        solution (QR-decomposition).

      <action dev="luc" type="add" due-to="Andreas Rieger">
        Support for one dimensional vectors has been added to the linear algebra

      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        New ODE integrators have been added: the explicit Adams-Bashforth and implicit
        Adams-Moulton multistep methods. As the implementations of these methods are based
        on Nordsieck vector rather than a traditional array of previous steps, they both
        have been improved to handle adaptive stepsize. These methods provide the same rich
        features has the existing ones: continuous output, step handlers, discrete events,

        Replaced size adjustment of all steps of fixed steps Runge-Kutta integrators by
        a truncation of the last step only.

      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        The ODE integrators now support several step handlers at once, instead of just one.
        This is more consistent with event handlers management.
        The setStepHandler method has therefore been replaced by addStephandler, the
        getStepHandler method has been replaced by getStepHandlers which returns a Collection

        All ODE integrators now support setting a maximal number of evaluations of differential
        equations function. If this number is exceeded, an exception will be thrown during
        integration. This can be used to prevent infinite loops if for example error control or
        discrete events create a really large number of extremely small steps.
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        All step interpolators for ODE integrators now provide interpolation for
        both the state and its time derivatives. The interpolated derivatives are
        the exact derivatives of the interpolated state, thus preserving consistency.
        The general step handlers hence do not need to call the derivation function
        anymore. The fixed step handlers also get the time derivative of the state
        as an additional argument along with the state when they are called.

      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="MATH-213" >
        Changed return type for FirstOrderIntegrator.integrate() to double
        in order to retrieve exact stop time. This allows to handle properly
        integration interruption due to an EventHandler instance asking to
        stop the integration when its associated event is triggered. The state
        was already set to the current state at interruption time, but it was
        difficult to get the corresponding time (it involved setting a step
        handler monitoring the last step specially).

        Starting with version 2.0 of the library, the minimal version of the Java
        platform required to compile and use Commons Math is Java 5. This version
        is widely deployed now on many systems. It brings new important features
        for specific mathematical developments, for example new functions (log10,
        cbrt, ulp, signum, cosh, sinh, tanh, hypot, expm1, log1p), autoboxing,
        MathContext or RoundingMode. It also brings important features for general

        Switching functions can now throw dedicated SwitchException from all their
