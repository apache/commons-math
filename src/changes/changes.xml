    </release>
    <release version="3.0" date="2012-03-07" description="
This is a major release: It combines bug fixes, new features and
changes to existing features.

Most notable among the new features are: Iterative solvers, Kalman filter,
ISAAC RNG, Illinois and Pegasus root finders, enhanced ODE framework,
refactored geometry package, Binary Space Partition trees.

Most notable among the changes are: Exclusive use of unchecked exceptions,
removal of interfaces for which a single implementation is assumed to exist,
improved coding and API consistency across packages, performance (matrix
product, FFT) and robustness (SVD).

Because of the base package name change, this release can be used together
with earlier versions of Commons Math.
The minimal version of the Java platform required to compile and use
Commons Math is Java 5.
Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as, in addition to new
features, this release includes numerous bug fixes.
Users of Commons Math 2.0-2 should recompile their code against the 3.0 JAR
file and must adjust the import statements to use the appropriate
org.apache.commons.math3 base package.
Most of the compilation errors users will encounter after the switch will
be due to moved or deleted classes/interfaces resulting from package
reorganization.

Caveat:
1. The implementation of the BOBYQA optimization algorithm is in alpha state
(cf. MATH-621): Many code paths are untested, and we are looking
for volunteers to improve the code readability, robustness and performance
and to extend the unit tests suite.
2. A few methods in the FastMath class are in fact slower that their
counterpart in either Math or StrictMath (cf. MATH-740).

    <release version="2.2" date="2011-03-02" description="
This is primarily a maintenance release, but it also includes new features and enhancements.

  Users of version 2.1 are encouraged to upgrade to 2.2, as this release includes some important bug fixes.

  See the detailed list of changes below for full description of all bug fixes and enhancements.

  This release contains some minor compatibility breaks with version 2.1 in some internal classes but none
  of them are in APIs likely to be accessed by user code:
  the MessagesResources_fr class has been removed (replaced by a properties file);
  the arguments of the EventState.reinitializeBegin method have changed;
  some protected fields which already had public accessors in AbstractStepInterpolator have been replaced.

  There is a behavior change that users of the multiple regression classes should be aware of. In version
  2.1, there was no way to estimate models without intercept terms, and, while this was not clear from
  the documentation, design (X) matrices needed to include initial unitary columns.  In 2.2, initial
  unitary columns are not necessary and whether or not models include intercept terms is configurable.
  See the change log and javadoc for the classes in org.apache.commons.math3.stat.regression for details.

  The major new features are:
  a new FastMath class, both faster, more accurate and with a few additional functions than StrictMath and Math;
  a new package for floating point arbitrary precision computing, including high level functions like exponential, sine, square root ...;
  new linear and tricubic interpolators;
  a new Gaussian curve fitter;
  a new erfc function;
  characteristic support for distributions;
  a set of new Well Equidistributed Long-period Linear (WELL) random generators.">

        newSampleData(double[], double[][]) and newSampleData(double[], double[][], double[][])
        all required columns of "1's" to be inserted into the x[][] arrays to
        create a model with an intercept term; while newSampleData(double[], int, int)
        created a model including an intercept term without requiring the
        unitary column. All methods have been changed to eliminate the need for
        users to add unitary columns to specify regression models.
        Users of OLSMultipleLinearRegression or GLSMultipleLinearRegression
        versions 2.0 or 2.1 should either verify that their code either does
        not use the first set of data loading methods above or set the noIntercept
        property on estimated models to get the previous behavior.

        infinities and NaNs are available (but there are no subnormals). All IEEE 854-1987 rounding modes and
        signaling flags are supported. The available operations are +, -, *, / and the available functions
        are sqrt, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, exp, log.

        still directly delegates to Math but this will improve with time. Some functions like exp
        may be twice as fast (even 3 times faster on some processors). Sine, cosine or power functions
        show typical speedups of 1.5 times faster or more.

        initial state and with respect to some problem parameters. This allows wrapping
        ODE solvers into optimization or root finding algorithms, which in turn can be
        used to solve Boundary Value Problems (BVP). There are no implementations (yet)
        of BVP solvers in the library.

    <release version="2.0" date="2009-08-03" description="
This is a major release. It combines bug fixes, new features and
changes to existing features. Most notable among the new features are:
decomposition algorithms in the linear algebra package (LU, QR, Cholesky,
SVD, eigen decomposition) which are based on the popular JAMA API (but
much faster); support for sparse matrices and vectors;
support for any field-based matrix (Complex, Fraction ...);
support for genetic algorithms;
several new optimization algorithms (Dantzig's simplex for linear
constrained problems, conjugate gradient, Brent);
support for curve fitting with special cases for harmonic and polynomial
functions;
support for state derivative in ODE step handlers;
new multistep integrators (Adams-Bashforth and Adams-Moulton) with
variable stepsize;
regression algorithms;
rank transformations;
Mersenne twister pseudo random number generator.
This release is NOT source and binary compatible with earlier versions
of Commons Math. Starting with version 2.0 of the library, the minimal
version of the Java platform required to compile and use Commons Math
is Java 5.  Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version, as in addition
to new features, this release includes numerous bug fixes.  Users of
Commons Math 1.0-1.2 should recompile their code against the 2.0 jar.
Most of the compilation errors users will encounter after the switch
will be due to classes moved due to package reorganization.  These errors
are simply solved by adjusting the import statements in users code.">

        The ODE integrators now support several step handlers at once, instead of just one.

        The general step handlers hence do not need to call the derivation function

      <action dev="psteitz" type="update">
        Added createXIdentityMatrix methods to MatrixUtils and deprecated
        getIdentity methods in RealMatrixImpl, BigMatrixImpl.
        Modified RealMatrixImpl, BigMatrixImpl constructors to throw
        IllegalArgumentExceptions instead of ArrayIndexOutOfBounds when
        dimension arguments are not positive.

      <action dev="psteitz" type="update">
        Made PRNG pluggable for classes in the random package.  Added
        RandomGenerator interface extracted from java.util.random and abstract
        implementation, AbstractRandomGenerator providing default
        implementations of methods based on nextDouble().  Added a constructor
        taking a RandomGenerator as an argument to RandomDataImpl.  Changed
        ValueServer to use a RandomData in its constructor.  Changes to
        1.0 classes should be backward compatible (including serialization).
