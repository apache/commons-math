 * such that ||A &times; X - B|| is minimal.
 * <p>
 * Some solvers like {@link LUDecomposition} can only find the solution for
 * square matrices and when the solution is an exact linear solution, i.e. when
 * ||A &times; X - B|| is exactly 0. Other solvers can also find solutions
 * with non-square matrix A and with non-null minimal norm. If an exact linear
 * solution exists it is also the minimal norm solution.
