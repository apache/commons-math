/**
 * Marker class for RealVectors that require sparse backing storage

 *  Caveat: Implementation are allowed to assume that, for any {@code x},
 *  the equality {@code x * 0d == 0d} holds. But it is is not true for
 *  {@code NaN}. Moreover, zero entries will lose their sign.
 *  Some operations (that involve {@code NaN} and/or infinities) may
 *  thus give incorrect results, like multiplications, divisions or
 *  functions mapping.
