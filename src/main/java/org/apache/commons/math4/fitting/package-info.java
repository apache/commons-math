/**
 * Classes to perform curve fitting.
 *
 * Curve fitting is a special case of a least-squares problem
 * where the parameters are the coefficients of a function \( f \)
 * whose graph \( y = f(x) \) should pass through sample points, and
 * were the objective function is the squared sum of the residuals
 * \( f(x_i) - y_i \) for observed points \( (x_i, y_i) \).
