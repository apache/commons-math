/**
 * This package provides algorithms that minimize the residuals
 * between observations and model values.
 * The {@link org.apache.commons.math4.fitting.leastsquares.LeastSquaresOptimizer
 * least-squares optimizers} minimize the distance (called
 * <em>cost</em> or <em>&chi;<sup>2</sup></em>) between model and
 * observations.
 *
 * <br/>
 * Algorithms in this category need access to a <em>problem</em>
 * (represented by a {@link org.apache.commons.math4.fitting.leastsquares.LeastSquaresProblem
 * LeastSquaresProblem}).
 * Such a model predicts a set of values which the algorithm tries to match
 * with a set of given set of observed values.
 * <br/>
 * The problem can be created progressively using a {@link
 * org.apache.commons.math4.fitting.leastsquares.LeastSquaresBuilder builder} or it can
 * be created at once using a {@link org.apache.commons.math4.fitting.leastsquares.LeastSquaresFactory
 * factory}.
 * @since 3.3
