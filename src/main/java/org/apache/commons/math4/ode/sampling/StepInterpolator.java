/** This interface represents an interpolator over the last step
 * during an ODE integration.
 *
 * <p>The various ODE integrators provide objects implementing this
 * interface to the step handlers. These objects are often custom
 * objects tightly bound to the integrator internal algorithms. The
 * handlers can use these objects to retrieve the state vector at
 * intermediate times between the previous and the current grid points
 * (this feature is often called dense output).</p>
 * <p>One important thing to note is that the step handlers may be so
 * tightly bound to the integrators that they often share some internal
 * state arrays. This imply that one should <em>never</em> use a direct
 * reference to a step interpolator outside of the step handler, either
 * for future use or for use in another thread. If such a need arise, the
 * step interpolator <em>must</em> be copied using the dedicated
 * {@link #copy()} method.
