/** This class converts second order differential equations to first
 * order ones.
 *
 * <p>This class is a wrapper around a {@link
 * SecondOrderDifferentialEquations} which allow to use a {@link
 * FirstOrderIntegrator} to integrate it.</p>
 *
 * <p>The transformation is done by changing the n dimension state
 * vector to a 2n dimension vector, where the first n components are
 * the initial state variables and the n last components are their
 * first time derivative. The first time derivative of this state
 * vector then really contains both the first and second time
 * derivative of the initial state vector, which can be handled by the
 * underlying second order equations set.</p>
 *
 * <p>One should be aware that the data is duplicated during the
 * transformation process and that for each call to {@link
 * #computeDerivatives computeDerivatives}, this wrapper does copy 4n
 * scalars : 2n before the call to {@link
 * SecondOrderDifferentialEquations#computeSecondDerivatives
 * computeSecondDerivatives} in order to dispatch the y state vector
 * into z and zDot, and 2n after the call to gather zDot and zDDot
 * into yDot. Since the underlying problem by itself perhaps also
 * needs to copy data and dispatch the arrays into domain objects,
 * this has an impact on both memory and CPU usage. The only way to
 * avoid this duplication is to perform the transformation at the
 * problem level, i.e. to implement the problem as a first order one
 * and then avoid using this class.</p>
