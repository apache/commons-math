/** This interface represents a handler for discrete events triggered
 * during ODE integration.
 *
 * <p>Some events can be triggered at discrete times as an ODE problem
 * is solved. This occurs for example when the integration process
 * should be stopped as some state is reached (G-stop facility) when the
 * precise date is unknown a priori, or when the derivatives have
 * discontinuities, or simply when the user wants to monitor some
 * states boundaries crossings.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>These events are defined as occurring when a <code>g</code>
 * switching function sign changes.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since events are only problem-dependent and are triggered by the
 * independent <i>time</i> variable and the state vector, they can
 * occur at virtually any time, unknown in advance. The integrators will
 * take care to avoid sign changes inside the steps, they will reduce
 * the step size when such an event is detected in order to put this
 * event exactly at the end of the current step. This guarantees that
 * step interpolation (which always has a one step scope) is relevant
 * even in presence of discontinuities. This is independent from the
 * stepsize control provided by integrators that monitor the local
 * error (this event handling feature is available for all integrators,
 * including fixed step ones).</p>

   * the stepsize in such a way these events occur exactly at step boundaries.
   * The switching function must be continuous in its roots neighborhood
   * (but not necessarily smooth), as the integrator will need to find its
   * roots to locate precisely the events.</p>
   * <p>Also note that the integrator expect that once an event has occurred,
   * the sign of the switching function at the start of the next step (i.e.
   * just after the event) is the opposite of the sign just before the event.
   * This consistency between the steps <string>must</strong> be preserved,
   * otherwise {@link org.apache.commons.math4.exception.NoBracketingException
   * exceptions} related to root not being bracketed will occur.</p>
   * <p>This need for consistency is sometimes tricky to achieve. A typical
   * example is using an event to model a ball bouncing on the floor. The first
   * idea to represent this would be to have {@code g(t) = h(t)} where h is the
   * height above the floor at time {@code t}. When {@code g(t)} reaches 0, the
   * ball is on the floor, so it should bounce and the typical way to do this is
   * to reverse its vertical velocity. However, this would mean that before the
   * event {@code g(t)} was decreasing from positive values to 0, and after the
   * event {@code g(t)} would be increasing from 0 to positive values again.
   * Consistency is broken here! The solution here is to have {@code g(t) = sign
   * * h(t)}, where sign is a variable with initial value set to {@code +1}. Each
   * time {@link #eventOccurred(double, double[], boolean) eventOccurred} is called,
   * {@code sign} is reset to {@code -sign}. This allows the {@code g(t)}
   * function to remain continuous (and even smooth) even across events, despite
   * {@code h(t)} is not. Basically, the event is used to <em>fold</em> {@code h(t)}
   * at bounce points, and {@code sign} is used to <em>unfold</em> it back, so the
   * solvers sees a {@code g(t)} function which behaves smoothly even across events.</p>

  /** Handle an event and choose what to do next.

   * <p>This method is called when the integrator has accepted a step

   * or continue integration, possibly with a reset state or derivatives.</p>

   *   <li>if {@link Action#STOP} is returned, the step handler will be called
   *   with the <code>isLast</code> flag of the {@link
   *   org.apache.commons.math4.ode.sampling.StepHandler#handleStep handleStep}
   *   method set to true and the integration will be stopped,</li>
   *   <li>if {@link Action#RESET_STATE} is returned, the {@link #resetState
   *   resetState} method will be called once the step handler has
   *   finished its task, and the integrator will also recompute the
   *   derivatives,</li>
   *   <li>if {@link Action#RESET_DERIVATIVES} is returned, the integrator
   *   will recompute the derivatives,

   *   will continue.</li>

   * org.apache.commons.math4.ode.sampling.StepHandler#handleStep(
   * org.apache.commons.math4.ode.sampling.StepInterpolator, boolean)
   * handleStep(interpolator, isLast)} is to call this method first and

   * handler to make it aware the step will be the last one if this method

   * does for example), user code called by this method and user
   * code called by step handlers may experience apparently out of order values
   * of the independent time variable. As an example, if the same user object
   * implements both this {@link EventHandler EventHandler} interface and the
   * {@link org.apache.commons.math4.ode.sampling.FixedStepHandler FixedStepHandler}
   * interface, a <em>forward</em> integration may call its
   * <code>eventOccurred</code> method with t = 10 first and call its
   * <code>handleStep</code> method with t = 9 afterwards. Such out of order
   * calls are limited to the size of the integration step for {@link
   * org.apache.commons.math4.ode.sampling.StepHandler variable step handlers} and
