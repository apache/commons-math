/** This interface represents a second order differential equations set.

 *
 * <p>A second order differential equations problem, as seen by an
 * integrator is the second time derivative <code>d2Y/dt^2</code> of a
 * state vector <code>Y</code>, both being one dimensional
 * arrays. From the integrator point of view, this derivative depends
 * only on the current time <code>t</code>, on the state vector
 * <code>Y</code> and on the first time derivative of the state
 * vector.</p>
 *
 * <p>For real problems, the derivative depends also on parameters
 * that do not belong to the state vector (dynamical model constants
 * for example). These constants are completely outside of the scope
 * of this interface, the classes that implement it are allowed to
 * handle them as they want.</p>
