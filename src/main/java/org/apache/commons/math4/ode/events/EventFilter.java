/** Wrapper used to detect only increasing or decreasing events.
 *
 * <p>General {@link EventHandler events} are defined implicitly
 * by a {@link EventHandler#g(double, double[]) g function} crossing
 * zero. This function needs to be continuous in the event neighborhood,
 * and its sign must remain consistent between events. This implies that
 * during an ODE integration, events triggered are alternately events
 * for which the function increases from negative to positive values,
 * and events for which the function decreases from positive to
 * negative values.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Sometimes, users are only interested in one type of event (say
 * increasing events for example) and not in the other type. In these
 * cases, looking precisely for all events location and triggering
 * events that will later be ignored is a waste of computing time.</p>
 *
 * <p>Users can wrap a regular {@link EventHandler event handler} in
 * an instance of this class and provide this wrapping instance to
 * the {@link org.apache.commons.math4.ode.FirstOrderIntegrator ODE solver}
 * in order to avoid wasting time looking for uninteresting events.
 * The wrapper will intercept the calls to the {@link
 * EventHandler#g(double, double[]) g function} and to the {@link
 * EventHandler#eventOccurred(double, double[], boolean)
 * eventOccurred} method in order to ignore uninteresting events. The
 * wrapped regular {@link EventHandler event handler} will the see only
 * the interesting events, i.e. either only {@code increasing} events or
 * {@code decreasing} events. the number of calls to the {@link
 * EventHandler#g(double, double[]) g function} will also be reduced.</p>
