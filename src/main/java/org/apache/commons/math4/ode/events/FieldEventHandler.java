/** This interface represents a handler for discrete events triggered
 * during ODE integration.
 *
 * <p>Some events can be triggered at discrete times as an ODE problem
 * is solved. This occurs for example when the integration process
 * should be stopped as some state is reached (G-stop facility) when the
 * precise date is unknown a priori, or when the derivatives have
 * discontinuities, or simply when the user wants to monitor some
 * states boundaries crossings.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>These events are defined as occurring when a <code>g</code>
 * switching function sign changes.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since events are only problem-dependent and are triggered by the
 * independent <i>time</i> variable and the state vector, they can
 * occur at virtually any time, unknown in advance. The integrators will
 * take care to avoid sign changes inside the steps, they will reduce
 * the step size when such an event is detected in order to put this
 * event exactly at the end of the current step. This guarantees that
 * step interpolation (which always has a one step scope) is relevant
 * even in presence of discontinuities. This is independent from the
 * stepsize control provided by integrators that monitor the local
 * error (this event handling feature is available for all integrators,
 * including fixed step ones).</p>

     * <p>The discrete events are generated when the sign of this
     * switching function changes. The integrator will take care to change
     * the stepsize in such a way these events occur exactly at step boundaries.
     * The switching function must be continuous in its roots neighborhood
     * (but not necessarily smooth), as the integrator will need to find its
     * roots to locate precisely the events.</p>
     * <p>Also note that the integrator expect that once an event has occurred,
     * the sign of the switching function at the start of the next step (i.e.
     * just after the event) is the opposite of the sign just before the event.
     * This consistency between the steps <string>must</strong> be preserved,
     * otherwise {@link org.apache.commons.math4.exception.NoBracketingException
     * exceptions} related to root not being bracketed will occur.</p>
     * <p>This need for consistency is sometimes tricky to achieve. A typical
     * example is using an event to model a ball bouncing on the floor. The first
     * idea to represent this would be to have {@code g(t) = h(t)} where h is the
     * height above the floor at time {@code t}. When {@code g(t)} reaches 0, the
     * ball is on the floor, so it should bounce and the typical way to do this is
     * to reverse its vertical velocity. However, this would mean that before the
     * event {@code g(t)} was decreasing from positive values to 0, and after the
     * event {@code g(t)} would be increasing from 0 to positive values again.
     * Consistency is broken here! The solution here is to have {@code g(t) = sign
     * * h(t)}, where sign is a variable with initial value set to {@code +1}. Each
     * time {@link #eventOccurred(FieldODEStateAndDerivative, boolean) eventOccurred}
     * method is called, {@code sign} is reset to {@code -sign}. This allows the
     * {@code g(t)} function to remain continuous (and even smooth) even across events,
     * despite {@code h(t)} is not. Basically, the event is used to <em>fold</em>
     * {@code h(t)} at bounce points, and {@code sign} is used to <em>unfold</em> it
     * back, so the solvers sees a {@code g(t)} function which behaves smoothly even
     * across events.</p>

     *   resetState} method will be called once the step handler has
     *   finished its task, and the integrator will also recompute the

     * pass <code>true</code> as the <code>isLast</code> parameter to the step

     * returns {@link Action#STOP}. As the interpolator may be used to navigate back
     * throughout the last step, user code called by this method and user
     * code called by step handlers may experience apparently out of order values
     * of the independent time variable. As an example, if the same user object
     * implements both this {@link FieldEventHandler FieldEventHandler} interface and the

     * interface, a <em>forward</em> integration may call its

     * {code handleStep} method with t = 9 afterwards. Such out of order
