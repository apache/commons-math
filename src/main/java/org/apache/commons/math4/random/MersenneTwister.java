/** This class implements a powerful pseudo-random number generator
 * developed by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura during
 * 1996-1997.
 *
 * <b>Caveat:</b> It is recommended to use one of WELL generators rather
 * than the MersenneTwister generator (see
 * <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~panneton/WELLRNG.html">
 * this paper</a> for more information).
 *
 * <p>This generator features an extremely long period
 * (2<sup>19937</sup>-1) and 623-dimensional equidistribution up to 32
 * bits accuracy. The home page for this generator is located at <a
 * href="http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html">
 * http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html</a>.</p>

 * <p>This generator is described in a paper by Makoto Matsumoto and
 * Takuji Nishimura in 1998: <a
 * href="http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/ARTICLES/mt.pdf">Mersenne
 * Twister: A 623-Dimensionally Equidistributed Uniform Pseudo-Random
 * Number Generator</a>, ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer
 * Simulation, Vol. 8, No. 1, January 1998, pp 3--30</p>

 * <p>This class is mainly a Java port of the 2002-01-26 version of
 * the generator written in C by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji
 * Nishimura. Here is their original copyright:</p>
