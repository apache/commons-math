/**
 * Implementation of a Halton sequence.
 * <p>
 * A Halton sequence is a low-discrepancy sequence generating points in the interval [0, 1] according to
 * <pre>
 *   H(n) = d_0 / b + d_1 / b^2 .... d_j / b^j+1
 *
 *   with
 *
 *   n = d_j * b^j-1 + ... d_1 * b + d_0 * b^0
 * </pre>
 * For higher dimensions, subsequent prime numbers are used as base, e.g. { 2, 3, 5 } for a Halton sequence in R^3.
 * <p>
 * Halton sequences are known to suffer from linear correlation for larger prime numbers, thus the individual digits
 * are usually scrambled. This implementation already comes with support for up to 40 dimensions with optimal weight
 * numbers from <a href="http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07062004-140409/unrestricted/dissertation1.pdf">
 * H. Chi: Scrambled quasirandom sequences and their applications</a>.
 * <p>
 * The generator supports two modes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>sequential generation of points: {@link #nextVector()}</li>
 *   <li>random access to the i-th point in the sequence: {@link #skipTo(int)}</li>
 * </ul>
