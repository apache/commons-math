/**
 * A {@link RandomVectorGenerator} that generates vectors with with
 * correlated components.
 * <p>Random vectors with correlated components are built by combining
 * the uncorrelated components of another random vector in such a way that
 * the resulting correlations are the ones specified by a positive
 * definite covariance matrix.</p>
 * <p>The main use for correlated random vector generation is for Monte-Carlo
 * simulation of physical problems with several variables, for example to
 * generate error vectors to be added to a nominal vector. A particularly
 * interesting case is when the generated vector should be drawn from a <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution">
 * Multivariate Normal Distribution</a>. The approach using a Cholesky
 * decomposition is quite usual in this case. However, it can be extended
 * to other cases as long as the underlying random generator provides
 * {@link NormalizedRandomGenerator normalized values} like {@link
 * GaussianRandomGenerator} or {@link UniformRandomGenerator}.</p>
 * <p>Sometimes, the covariance matrix for a given simulation is not
 * strictly positive definite. This means that the correlations are
 * not all independent from each other. In this case, however, the non
 * strictly positive elements found during the Cholesky decomposition
 * of the covariance matrix should not be negative either, they
 * should be null. Another non-conventional extension handling this case
 * is used here. Rather than computing <code>C = U<sup>T</sup>.U</code>
 * where <code>C</code> is the covariance matrix and <code>U</code>
 * is an upper-triangular matrix, we compute <code>C = B.B<sup>T</sup></code>
 * where <code>B</code> is a rectangular matrix having
 * more rows than columns. The number of columns of <code>B</code> is
 * the rank of the covariance matrix, and it is the dimension of the
 * uncorrelated random vector that is needed to compute the component
 * of the correlated vector. This class handles this situation
 * automatically.</p>
