/**
 * Update formula for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohonen">
 * Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map</a>.
 * <br/>
 * The {@link #update(Network,double[]) update} method modifies the
 * features {@code w} of the "winning" neuron and its neighbours
 * according to the following rule:
 * <code>
 *  w<sub>new</sub> = w<sub>old</sub> + &alpha; e<sup>(-d / &sigma;)</sup> * (sample - w<sub>old</sub>)
 * </code>
 * where
 * <ul>
 *  <li>&alpha; is the current <em>learning rate</em>, </li>
 *  <li>&sigma; is the current <em>neighbourhood size</em>, and</li>
 *  <li>{@code d} is the number of links to traverse in order to reach
 *   the neuron from the winning neuron.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br/>
 * This class is thread-safe as long as the arguments passed to the
 * {@link #KohonenUpdateAction(DistanceMeasure,LearningFactorFunction,
 * NeighbourhoodSizeFunction) constructor} are instances of thread-safe
 * classes.
 * <br/>
 * Each call to the {@link #update(Network,double[]) update} method
 * will increment the internal counter used to compute the current
 * values for
 * <ul>
 *  <li>the <em>learning rate</em>, and</li>
 *  <li>the <em>neighbourhood size</em>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Consequently, the function instances that compute those values (passed
 * to the constructor of this class) must take into account whether this
 * class's instance will be shared by multiple threads, as this will impact
 * the training process.

 * @since 3.3
