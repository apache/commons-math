/**
 * This interface specifies how to check if an optimization algorithm has
 * converged.
 * <br/>
 * Deciding if convergence has been reached is a problem-dependent issue. The
 * user should provide a class implementing this interface to allow the
 * optimization algorithm to stop its search according to the problem at hand.
 * <br/>
 * For convenience, three implementations that fit simple needs are already
 * provided: {@link SimpleValueChecker}, {@link SimpleVectorValueChecker} and
 * {@link SimplePointChecker}. The first two consider that convergence is
 * reached when the objective function value does not change much anymore, it
 * does not use the point set at all.
 * The third one considers that convergence is reached when the input point
 * set does not change much anymore, it does not use objective function value
 * at all.
 *
 * @param <PAIR> Type of the (point, objective value) pair.
