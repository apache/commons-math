/**
 * This class converts
 * {@link MultivariateVectorFunction vectorial objective functions} to
 * {@link MultivariateFunction scalar objective functions}
 * when the goal is to minimize them.
 * <br/>
 * This class is mostly used when the vectorial objective function represents
 * a theoretical result computed from a point set applied to a model and
 * the models point must be adjusted to fit the theoretical result to some
 * reference observations. The observations may be obtained for example from
 * physical measurements whether the model is built from theoretical
 * considerations.
 * <br/>
 * This class computes a possibly weighted squared sum of the residuals, which is
 * a scalar value. The residuals are the difference between the theoretical model
 * (i.e. the output of the vectorial objective function) and the observations. The
 * class implements the {@link MultivariateFunction} interface and can therefore be
 * minimized by any optimizer supporting scalar objectives functions.This is one way
 * to perform a least square estimation. There are other ways to do this without using
 * this converter, as some optimization algorithms directly support vectorial objective
 * functions.
 * <br/>
 * This class support combination of residuals with or without weights and correlations.
