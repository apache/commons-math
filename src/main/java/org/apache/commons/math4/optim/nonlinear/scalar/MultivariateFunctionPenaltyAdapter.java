/**
 * <p>Adapter extending bounded {@link MultivariateFunction} to an unbouded
 * domain using a penalty function.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This adapter can be used to wrap functions subject to simple bounds on
 * parameters so they can be used by optimizers that do <em>not</em> directly
 * support simple bounds.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The principle is that the user function that will be wrapped will see its
 * parameters bounded as required, i.e when its {@code value} method is called
 * with argument array {@code point}, the elements array will fulfill requirement
 * {@code lower[i] <= point[i] <= upper[i]} for all i. Some of the components
 * may be unbounded or bounded only on one side if the corresponding bound is
 * set to an infinite value. The optimizer will not manage the user function by
 * itself, but it will handle this adapter and it is this adapter that will take
 * care the bounds are fulfilled. The adapter {@link #value(double[])} method will
 * be called by the optimizer with unbound parameters, and the adapter will check
 * if the parameters is within range or not. If it is in range, then the underlying
 * user function will be called, and if it is not the value of a penalty function
 * will be returned instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This adapter is only a poor-man's solution to simple bounds optimization
 * constraints that can be used with simple optimizers like
 * {@link org.apache.commons.math4.optim.nonlinear.scalar.noderiv.SimplexOptimizer
 * SimplexOptimizer}.
 * A better solution is to use an optimizer that directly supports simple bounds like
 * {@link org.apache.commons.math4.optim.nonlinear.scalar.noderiv.CMAESOptimizer
 * CMAESOptimizer} or
 * {@link org.apache.commons.math4.optim.nonlinear.scalar.noderiv.BOBYQAOptimizer
 * BOBYQAOptimizer}.
 * One caveat of this poor-man's solution is that if start point or start simplex
 * is completely outside of the allowed range, only the penalty function is used,
 * and the optimizer may converge without ever entering the range.
 * </p>

     * When the optimizer provided points are out of range, the value of the
     * penalty function will be used instead of the value of the underlying
     * function. In order for this penalty to be effective in rejecting this
     * point during the optimization process, the penalty function value should
     * be defined with care. This value is computed as:
     * <pre>
     *   penalty(point) = offset + &sum;<sub>i</sub>[scale[i] * &radic;|point[i]-boundary[i]|]
     * </pre>
     * where indices i correspond to all the components that violates their boundaries.

     * <p>
     * So when attempting a function minimization, offset should be larger than
     * the maximum expected value of the underlying function and scale components
     * should all be positive. When attempting a function maximization, offset
     * should be lesser than the minimum expected value of the underlying function
     * and scale components should all be negative.

     * These choices for the penalty function have two properties. First, all out
     * of range points will return a function value that is worse than the value
     * returned by any in range point. Second, the penalty is worse for large
     * boundaries violation than for small violations, so the optimizer has an hint
