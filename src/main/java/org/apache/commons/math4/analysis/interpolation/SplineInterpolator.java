/**
 * Computes a natural (also known as "free", "unclamped") cubic spline interpolation for the data set.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #interpolate(double[], double[])} method returns a {@link PolynomialSplineFunction}
 * consisting of n cubic polynomials, defined over the subintervals determined by the x values,
 * {@code x[0] < x[i] ... < x[n].}  The x values are referred to as "knot points."</p>
 * <p>
 * The value of the PolynomialSplineFunction at a point x that is greater than or equal to the smallest
 * knot point and strictly less than the largest knot point is computed by finding the subinterval to which
 * x belongs and computing the value of the corresponding polynomial at <code>x - x[i] </code> where
 * <code>i</code> is the index of the subinterval.  See {@link PolynomialSplineFunction} for more details.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The interpolating polynomials satisfy: <ol>
 * <li>The value of the PolynomialSplineFunction at each of the input x values equals the
 *  corresponding y value.</li>
 * <li>Adjacent polynomials are equal through two derivatives at the knot points (i.e., adjacent polynomials
 *  "match up" at the knot points, as do their first and second derivatives).</li>
 * </ol></p>
 * <p>
 * The cubic spline interpolation algorithm implemented is as described in R.L. Burden, J.D. Faires,
 * <u>Numerical Analysis</u>, 4th Ed., 1989, PWS-Kent, ISBN 0-53491-585-X, pp 126-131.
