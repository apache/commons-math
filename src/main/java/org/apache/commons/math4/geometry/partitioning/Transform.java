 *   </li>

 *     the transform can be applied to a (D-1)-dimension
 *     hyperplane in the D-dimension space using its
 *     {@link #apply(Hyperplane)} method
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     the transform can be applied to a (D-2)-dimension
 *     sub-hyperplane in a (D-1)-dimension hyperplane using
 *     its {@link #apply(SubHyperplane, Hyperplane, Hyperplane)}
 *     method
 *   </li>
