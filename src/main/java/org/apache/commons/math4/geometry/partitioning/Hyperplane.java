/** This interface represents an hyperplane of a space.

 * <p>The most prominent place where hyperplane appears in space
 * partitioning is as cutters. Each partitioning node in a {@link
 * BSPTree BSP tree} has a cut {@link SubHyperplane sub-hyperplane}
 * which is either an hyperplane or a part of an hyperplane. In an
 * n-dimensions euclidean space, an hyperplane is an (n-1)-dimensions
 * hyperplane (for example a traditional plane in the 3D euclidean
 * space). They can be more exotic objects in specific fields, for
 * example a circle on the surface of the unit sphere.</p>

 * <p>
 * Note that this interface is <em>not</em> intended to be implemented
 * by Apache Commons Math users, it is only intended to be implemented
 * within the library itself. New methods may be added even for minor
 * versions, which breaks compatibility for external implementations.
 * </p>
