/** This class represent a Binary Space Partition tree.

 * <p>BSP trees are an efficient way to represent space partitions and
 * to associate attributes with each cell. Each node in a BSP tree
 * represents a convex region which is partitioned in two convex
 * sub-regions at each side of a cut hyperplane. The root tree
 * contains the complete space.</p>

 * <p>The main use of such partitions is to use a boolean attribute to
 * define an inside/outside property, hence representing arbitrary
 * polytopes (line segments in 1D, polygons in 2D and polyhedrons in
 * 3D) and to operate on them.</p>

 * <p>Another example would be to represent Voronoi tesselations, the
 * attribute of each cell holding the defining point of the cell.</p>

 * <p>The application-defined attributes are shared among copied
 * instances and propagated to split parts. These attributes are not
 * used by the BSP-tree algorithms themselves, so the application can
 * use them for any purpose. Since the tree visiting method holds
 * internal and leaf nodes differently, it is possible to use
 * different classes for internal nodes attributes and leaf nodes
 * attributes. This should be used with care, though, because if the
 * tree is modified in any way after attributes have been set, some
 * internal nodes may become leaf nodes and some leaf nodes may become
 * internal nodes.</p>

 * <p>One of the main sources for the development of this package was
 * Bruce Naylor, John Amanatides and William Thibault paper <a
 * href="http://www.cs.yorku.ca/~amana/research/bsptSetOp.pdf">Merging
 * BSP Trees Yields Polyhedral Set Operations</a> Proc. Siggraph '90,
 * Computer Graphics 24(4), August 1990, pp 115-124, published by the
 * Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).</p>
