/** This interface defines mappers between a space and one of its sub-spaces.

 * <p>Sub-spaces are the lower dimensions subsets of a n-dimensions
 * space. The (n-1)-dimension sub-spaces are specific sub-spaces known
 * as {@link Hyperplane hyperplanes}. This interface can be used regardless
 * of the dimensions differences. As an example, {@link
 * org.apache.commons.math4.geometry.euclidean.threed.Line Line} in 3D
 * implements Embedding<{@link
 * org.apache.commons.math4.geometry.euclidean.threed.Vector3D Vector3D}, {link
 * org.apache.commons.math4.geometry.euclidean.oned.Vector1D Vector1D}, i.e. it
 * maps directly dimensions 3 and 1.</p>

 * <p>In the 3D euclidean space, hyperplanes are 2D planes, and the 1D
 * sub-spaces are lines.</p>

 * <p>
 * Note that this interface is <em>not</em> intended to be implemented
 * by Apache Commons Math users, it is only intended to be implemented
 * within the library itself. New methods may be added even for minor
 * versions, which breaks compatibility for external implementations.
 * </p>
