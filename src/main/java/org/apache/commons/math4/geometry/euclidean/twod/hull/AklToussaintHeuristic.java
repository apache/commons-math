/**
 * A simple heuristic to improve the performance of convex hull algorithms.
 * <p>
 * The heuristic is based on the idea of a convex quadrilateral, which is formed by
 * four points with the lowest and highest x / y coordinates. Any point that lies inside
 * this quadrilateral can not be part of the convex hull and can thus be safely discarded
 * before generating the convex hull itself.
 * <p>
 * The complexity of the operation is O(n), and may greatly improve the time it takes to
 * construct the convex hull afterwards, depending on the point distribution.
 *
