This package provides classes to solve estimation problems.

<p>The estimation problems considered here are parametric problems where a user model
depends on initially unknown scalar parameters and several measurements made on
values that depend on the model are available. As an example, one can consider the
flow rate of a river given rain data on its vicinity, or the center and radius of a
circle given points on a ring.</p>

<p>One important class of estimation problems is weighted least squares problems.
They basically consist in finding the values for some parameters p<sub>k</sub> such
that a cost function J = sum(w<sub>i</sub> r<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>) is minimized.
The various r<sub>i</sub> terms represent the deviation r<sub>i</sub> =
mes<sub>i</sub> - mod<sub>i</sub> between the measurements and the parameterized
models. The w<sub>i</sub> factors are the measurements weights, they are often chosen
either all equal to 1.0 or proportional to the inverse of the variance of the
measurement type. The solver adjusts the values of the estimated parameters
p<sub>k</sub> which are not bound. It does not touch the parameters which have been
put in a bound state by the user.</p>
 
<p>This package provides the {@link
org.apache.commons.math.estimation.EstimatedParameter EstimatedParameter} class to
represent each estimated parameter, and the {@link
org.apache.commons.math.estimation.WeightedMeasurement WeightedMeasurement} abstract
class the user can extend to define its measurements. All parameters and measurements
are then provided to some {@link org.apache.commons.math.estimation.Estimator
Estimator} packed together in an {@link
org.apache.commons.math.estimation.EstimationProblem EstimationProblem} instance
which acts only as a container. The package provides two common estimators for
weighted least squares problems, one based on the {@link
org.apache.commons.math.estimation.GaussNewtonEstimator Gauss-Newton} method and the
other one based on the {@link
org.apache.commons.math.estimation.LevenbergMarquardtEstimator Levenberg-Marquardt}
method.</p>
