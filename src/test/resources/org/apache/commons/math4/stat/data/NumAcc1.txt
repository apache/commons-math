Dataset Name:  NumAcc1

Description:   This is a constructed/fabricated data set
               to test accuracy in summary statistic calculations.
               The numbers are large (8-digit integers) and
               differ only in the last decimal place.
               Note--by construction, this data set has
                     sample mean                  = 10000002 (exact)
                     sample standard deviation    =        1 (exact)
                     sample autocorrelation coef. =     -0.5 (exact)

Stat Category: Univariate: Summary Statistics
