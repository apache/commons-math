/**
 * This class is used in the junit tests for the ODE integrators.

 * <p>This specific problem is the following differential equation :
 * <pre>
 *    y' = 3x^5 - y
 * </pre>
 * when the initial condition is y(0) = -360, the solution of this
 * equation degenerates to a simple quintic polynomial function :
 * <pre>
 *   y (t) = 3x^5 - 15x^4 + 60x^3 - 180x^2 + 360x - 360
 * </pre>
