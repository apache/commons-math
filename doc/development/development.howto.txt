This document summarizes a discussion that took place on the "dev" ML:

The conclusions reported here are based on ideas presented in this blog post:
  http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

1. A tag in git will represent a full release (from a release candidate that
   passed a vote). Note, this tag will not have the suffix "RC#", as tags
   with that suffix represent a release candidate.
2. Contents that is candidate for being released must be merged into the
   "release" branch, from the "master" branch.
3. The "master" branch collects all modifications that will be part
   of the next release.
   Usually, changes should not be committed directly to the "master"
   branch; they should be merged from a branch specifically created for
   that purpose (see next point).
4. Work on an identified issue (bug fix or new feature) must be done in a
   new branch named after its corresponding report in the bug-tracking
   system (JIRA), e.g. "feature-MATH-1319".
   After completion, and in the absence of technical objections, the feature
   branch is merged into the "master" branch, using the "--no-ff" git
   option.
   That feature branch is then deleted.
