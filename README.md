"Commons Math" is undergoing major changes towards the next release (4.0):
+ Low-level functionality has been split off to new components, often with many bug-fixes, performance enhancements and improved API:
  + "Commons Numbers" <https://commons.apache.org/numbers>
  + "Commons RNG" <https://commons.apache.org/rng>
  + "Commons Geometry" <https://commons.apache.org/geometry>
  + "Commons Statistics" <https://commons.apache.org/statistics>
+ Functionality still within "Commons Math" is gradually being modularized and refactored.
