/**
 * <p>Random Data Generation</p>
 *
 * <p>
 *  Some of the utilities in this package use the pseudo-random number
 *  generators defined in the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/rng">
 *  Commons RNG</a> library in order to provide
 *  {@link org.apache.commons.math4.legacy.random.RandomUtils.DataGenerator
 *  higher level functionality} (such as random strings) based on an underlying
 *  source of randomness that provides sequences of uniformly distributed integers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  Others are sources of pseudo-randomness that directly produce "compound" types
 *  such as {@link org.apache.commons.math4.legacy.random.RandomVectorGenerator random vectors}.
